## Brief description of web page developed 

My website is a restuarant site that displays the menu . It has the DishID,DishName, RecipeChef,
PrepTimeMinutes,Price and CurrentAvailability which is displayed as "Avaliability" as the header on the table.
In order to use the filter function on my website all users have to do is type in what they are looking for . Users need to keep
in mind that the function filters based on dishName. Once the user starts to type if the value which they have typed in that order 
is in the one of the dish name then it will remain . It is advised to type at least four letter and above to get the best result but it works either way .
